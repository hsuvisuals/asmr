        <h2>About this Page</h2>
            <p>Hello! Welcome to my ASMR website. This website is my critque on ASMR videos and why people
              watch ASMR channels to begin with. I have always wondered why people enjoy watching people eat on Youtube
              or instagram. ASMR has become such a cultural phenomenon and alot of people watch and subcribe to these Youtubers.
              For example, Quang Tran, the person I watched as I ate in my video has 1.3 million subcribers and 217,371,024 views as of April 15, 2019.
              SAS-ASMR has 6,145,158 subscribers and 1,269,308,820 views. Zach Choi ASMR has 973,624 subscribers and 98,511,624 views. With these examples, it is
              clearly obvious of how popular ASMR is.</p>
